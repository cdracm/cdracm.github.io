*Workplace: the final frontier.<br> 
These are the voyages of an employee from the Enterprise.<br>
His twenty-five-year mission: to explore strange new bugs in the code,<br> 
to give it new life, so that new civilizations<br>
wouldn't leave Earth at once after looking at it, to boldly go<br> 
where no man in his right mind has opened the source before!*
